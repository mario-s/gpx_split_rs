## GPX file splitter

This tool can split a route or track of GPX file into smaller chunks. It will create new files, where each one has a suffix to the filename like so <NAME>_1.gpx.

Inspired by my [earlier project](https://github.com/mario-s/gpx_split_py) which uses Python, but this time in Rust.
